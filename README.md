# Robot Controller

The Robot Controller navigates 2-dimensional grids under the user''s commands, and responds to obstacles in its way. 

## Getting Started

1. Open the solution file RobotController.sln in Visual Studio.
2. Go to "Build" -> "Build Solution" to build all three projects in this solution, the main class library, the unit tests and a console app.
3. Go to "Tests" -> "Run All Tests" to verify that all unit tests are successful.
4. Press F5 to run a simple console app that configures the grid and obstacles, takes a series of commands L/R/F/B from the user and shows the route that the robot takes.
